\title{XReview: Basics}
\date{}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\textit{xreview} allows you to quickly show and hide changes to a document.
This is achieved providing two commands:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \writecommand{showchanges} to annotate the changes;
    \item \writecommand{showclean} to compile a clean document.
\end{itemize}

Changes can be annotated mostly using the commands:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \writecommand{removed} for \removed{removed sections}
    \item \writecommand{added} for \added{added sections}
    \item \writecommand{changed} for sections that have been \changed{changed}{modified}
\end{itemize}

Here is a simple example of the package in use!

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.3\linewidth}

\writecommand{textit} \writearg{xreview} is a \writecommand{removed} \writearg{fantastic} package to help \writecommand{added} \writearg{\writecommand{LaTex}} authors review their manuscripts to respond to the \writecommand{changed}\writearg{annoying} \writearg{valuable} modifications suggested by referees.

\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.3\linewidth}
\writecommand{showchanges}
\showchanges

\textit{xreview} is a \removed{fantastic} package to help \added{\LaTeX} authors review their manuscripts to respond to the \changed{annoying}{valuable} modifications suggested by referees.

\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.3\linewidth}   
\writecommand{showclean}
\showclean

\textit{xreview} is a \removed{fantastic} package to help \added{\LaTeX} authors review their manuscripts to respond to the \changed{annoying}{valuable} modifications suggested by referees.
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
