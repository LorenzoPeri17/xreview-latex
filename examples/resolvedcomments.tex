\title{XReview: Resolved Comments}
\date{}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

Sometimes comments tend to stick around for \textit{a while}. However, this has the downside of hiding which have been resolved and which are still outstanding. 
To avoid this anti-pattern, \textit{xreview} offers the command \writecommand{resolvedcomment} to mark a comment as resolved!
Changing \writecommand{comment} to \writecommand{resolvedcomment} will make outstanding matters stand out atop a sea of calming satisfying green.
