DESCRIPTION
===========

This package provides a simple way to review LaTeX documents. It allows to higlight and/or hide changes to a document, and to add comments to the text. This will help you to keep track of the changes you make to a document, and to easily spot the changes made by others, while always having the option of toggling a clean version of the document.

This package also offers a way to include comments in the text, which can be toggled on and off. This is useful for adding notes to the text, or for leaving comments to other authors.
